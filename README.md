### Property List

---

This is my solution for the code challenge given by REA.
With the given JSON mock data, I displayed it in a row of results and saved properties.

Technoligies Used: ReactJS, BootStrap

I used create-react-app for the boilerplate of the application.

##### Bugs
Since I've used the hover property for displaying the buttons add and remove, it wouldn't work on mobiles.

Deployed on Github Pages.
